# Introduction
[Explanatory video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Jkgvw-Z6E)

When a ferromagnetic metal pendulum hangs above a trio of magnetized surfaces, it gravitates toward them, settling into a stable state.

By adding color to these magnets and releasing the pendulum from various points, we create a fractal pattern, drawing each initial position with the corresponding magnet color.

This program offers an interactive and user-friendly simulation of this physical phenomenon.
### Instructions
Move the camera with the arrow keys.
Zoom in and out with the `Q` and `W` keys, reset the camera with the `E` key. Click and drag any attractor to change its position, and you can use the pop-up window to change its properties like color and mass.
