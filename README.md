When a ferromagnetic metal pendulum hangs above a trio of magnetized surfaces, it gravitates toward them, settling into a stable state.

By adding color to these magnets and releasing the pendulum from various points, we create a fractal pattern, drawing each initial position with the corresponding magnet color.

This program offers an interactive and user-friendly simulation of this physical phenomenon.
